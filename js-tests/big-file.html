        <p><b>Napoleon Bonaparte</b><sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> (15 August 1769&#160;– 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader during the latter stages of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. As <b>Napoleon I</b>, he was <a href="/wiki/Emperor_of_the_French" title="Emperor of the French">Emperor of the French</a> from 1804 to 1815. His legal reform, the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_code" title="Napoleonic code">Napoleonic code</a>, has been a major influence on many <a href="/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a> jurisdictions worldwide, but he is best remembered for his role in the wars led against France by a series of coalitions, the so-called <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, during which he established hegemony over most of continental Europe and sought to spread the ideals of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, while consolidating an <a href="/wiki/First_French_Empire" title="First French Empire">imperial monarchy</a> which restored aspects of the deposed <a href="/wiki/Ancien_R%C3%A9gime_in_France" title="Ancien Régime in France">ancien régime</a>. Due to his longtime success in these wars, often against numerically superior enemies, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time.</p>
<p>Napoleon was born in <a href="/wiki/Corsica" title="Corsica">Corsica</a> to parents of <a href="/wiki/Nobility_of_Italy" title="Nobility of Italy">noble Genoese</a> ancestry and trained as an artillery officer in mainland France. Bonaparte rose to prominence under the <a href="/wiki/French_First_Republic" title="French First Republic">French First Republic</a> and led successful campaigns against the <a href="/wiki/First_Coalition" title="First Coalition" class="mw-redirect">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Second_Coalition" title="War of the Second Coalition">Second</a> Coalitions arrayed against France. In 1799, he staged a <i><a href="/wiki/18_Brumaire" title="18 Brumaire">coup d'état</a></i> and installed himself as <a href="/wiki/First_Consul" title="First Consul" class="mw-redirect">First Consul</a>; five years later the French Senate proclaimed him emperor. In the first decade of the 19th century, the <a href="/wiki/First_French_Empire" title="First French Empire">French Empire</a> under Napoleon engaged in a series of conflicts—the Napoleonic Wars—involving every major European power. After a streak of victories, France secured a dominant position in continental Europe, and Napoleon maintained the French <a href="/wiki/Sphere_of_influence" title="Sphere of influence">sphere of influence</a> through the formation of extensive alliances and the appointment of friends and family members to rule other European countries as French <a href="/wiki/Client_state" title="Client state">client states</a>. Napoleon's campaigns are studied at military academies throughout much of the world.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Peninsular_War" title="Peninsular War">fight against the guerilla in Spain</a> and 1812 <a href="/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia" title="French invasion of Russia">French invasion of Russia</a> marked turning points in Napoleon's fortunes. His <i><a href="/wiki/Grande_Arm%C3%A9e" title="Grande Armée">Grande Armée</a></i> was badly damaged in the campaign and never fully recovered. In 1813, the <a href="/wiki/Sixth_Coalition" title="Sixth Coalition" class="mw-redirect">Sixth Coalition</a> defeated his forces <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Leipzig" title="Battle of Leipzig">at Leipzig</a>; the following year the Coalition invaded France, forced Napoleon to abdicate and exiled him to the island of <a href="/wiki/Elba" title="Elba">Elba</a>. Less than a year later, he escaped Elba and returned to power, but was defeated at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> in June 1815. Napoleon spent the last six years of his life in confinement by the British on the island of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Helena" title="Saint Helena">Saint Helena</a>. An autopsy concluded he died of <a href="/wiki/Stomach_cancer" title="Stomach cancer">stomach cancer</a>, although this claim has sparked significant debate, and some scholars (most notably <a href="/wiki/Sten_Forshufvud" title="Sten Forshufvud">Sten Forshufvud</a>) have held that he was a victim of <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a> poisoning.</p>

<p>His application of conventional military ideas to real-world situations effected his military triumphs, such as creative use of artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry.

</div>
</div>
<p>Seeking national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_VII" title="Pope Pius VII">Pope Pius VII</a>. It solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France and brought back most of its civil status.</p>
<p>During the French Revolution, the <a href="/wiki/National_Assembly_(French_Revolution)" title="National Assembly (French Revolution)">National Assembly</a> had taken Church properties and issued the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Constitution_of_the_Clergy" title="Civil Constitution of the Clergy">Civil Constitution of the Clergy</a>, which made the Church a department of the State, removing it from the authority of the <a href="/wiki/Pope" title="Pope">Pope</a>.

Subsequent laws abolished the traditional <a href="/wiki/Gregorian_calendar" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> and Christian holidays.</p>
<p>While the Concordat restored some ties to the papacy, it was largely in favor of the state; the balance of church-state relations had tilted firmly in Napoleon's favour. Now, Napoleon could win favor with the Catholics within France while also controlling Rome in a political sense. Napoleon once told his brother Lucien in April 1801, "Skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests. They can both contain them and use them."<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97"><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup> As a part of the Concordat, he presented another set of laws called the <a href="/wiki/Organic_Articles" title="Organic Articles">Organic Articles</a>.</p>

<p>There was a lull in fighting over the winter of 1812–13 while both the Russians and the French rebuilt their forces; Napoleon was then able to field 350,000 troops.<sup id="cite_ref-140" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-140"><span>[</span>133<span>]</span></a></sup> Heartened by France's loss in Russia, Prussia joined with Austria, Sweden, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal in a new coalition. Napoleon assumed command in Germany and inflicted a series of defeats on the Coalition culminating in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dresden" title="Battle of Dresden">Battle of Dresden</a> in August 1813.<sup id="cite_ref-141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-141"><span>[</span>134<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite these successes, the numbers continued to mount against Napoleon, and the French army was pinned down by a force twice its size and lost at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Leipzig" title="Battle of Leipzig">Battle of Leipzig</a>.

<p>Separated from his wife and son, who had come under Austrian control, cut off from the allowance guaranteed to him by the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and aware of rumours he was about to be banished to a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean, Napoleon escaped from Elba on 26 February 1815. He landed at <a href="/wiki/Golfe-Juan" title="Golfe-Juan">Golfe-Juan</a> on the French mainland, two days later.<sup id="cite_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-149"><span>[</span>142<span>]</span></a></sup> The 5th Regiment was sent to intercept him and made contact <a href="/wiki/Route_Napol%C3%A9on" title="Route Napoléon">just south</a> of <a href="/wiki/Grenoble" title="Grenoble">Grenoble</a> on 7 March 1815.

On 13 March, the powers at the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna" title="Congress of Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> declared Napoleon an <a href="/wiki/Outlaw" title="Outlaw">outlaw</a>, and four days later Great Britain, Russia, Austria and Prussia bound themselves to each put 150,000 men into the field to end his rule.<sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151"><span>[</span>144<span>]</span></a></sup> Napoleon arrived in Paris on 20 March and governed for a period now called the Hundred Days.

Wellington's army withstood repeated attacks by the French and drove them from the field while the Prussians arrived in force and broke through Napoleon's right flank.

His health that day may have affected his presence and vigour on the field, added to the fact that his subordinates may have let him down. Despite this, Napoleon came very close to clinching victory.

<i>Napoléon sur son lit de mort</i> (Napoleon on his death bed), by <a href="/wiki/Horace_Vernet" title="Horace Vernet">Horace Vernet</a>, 1826.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1955, the diaries of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, appeared in print. His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led <a href="/wiki/Sten_Forshufvud" title="Sten Forshufvud">Sten Forshufvud</a> to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate <a href="/wiki/Arsenic_poisoning" title="Arsenic poisoning">arsenic poisoning</a>, in a 1961 paper in <i><a href="/wiki/Nature_(journal)" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Cullen_171-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cullen-171"><span>[</span>162<span>]</span></a></sup> Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with <a href="/wiki/Ben_Weider" title="Ben Weider">Ben Weider</a>, noted the emperor's body was found to be remarkably well-preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking high levels of <a href="/wiki/Orgeat_syrup" title="Orgeat syrup">orgeat syrup</a> that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring. They maintained that the <a href="/wiki/Potassium_tartrate" title="Potassium tartrate">potassium tartrate</a> used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expellation of these compounds and that the thirst was a symptom of poisoning. Their hypothesis was that the <a href="/wiki/Calomel" title="Calomel" class="mw-redirect">calomel</a> given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left behind extensive <a href="/wiki/Tissue_(biology)" title="Tissue (biology)">tissue</a> damage.<sup id="cite_ref-Cullen_171-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cullen-171"><span>[</span>162<span>]</span></a></sup> A 2007 article stated the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral type, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion his death was murder.<sup id="cite_ref-cullen156_172-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cullen156-172"><span>[</span>163<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The wallpaper used in Longwood contained a high level of arsenic compound used for colouring by British manufacturers. The adhesive, which in the cooler British environment was innocuous, may have grown mould in the more humid climate and emitted the poisonous gas <a href="/wiki/Arsine" title="Arsine">arsine</a>. This theory has been ruled out as it does not explain the arsenic absorption patterns found in other analyses.<sup id="cite_ref-Cullen_171-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cullen-171"><span>[</span>162<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>There have been modern studies which have supported the original autopsy finding.<sup id="cite_ref-cullen156_172-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cullen156-172"><span>[</span>163<span>]</span></a></sup> Researchers, in a 2008 study, analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, and from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.<sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174"><span>[</span>note 11<span>]</span></a></sup> 2007 and 2008 studies dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.<sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175"><span>[</span>165<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>Napoleon married <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9phine_de_Beauharnais" title="Joséphine de Beauharnais">Joséphine de Beauharnais</a> in 1796, when he was twenty-six; she was a thirty-two-year-old widow whose first husband had been executed during the Revolution. Until she met Bonaparte, she had been known as 'Rose', a name which he disliked. He called her 'Joséphine' instead, and she went by this name henceforth. Bonaparte often sent her love letters while on his campaigns.<sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176"><span>[</span>166<span>]</span></a></sup> He formally adopted her son <a href="/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_de_Beauharnais" title="Eugène de Beauharnais">Eugène</a> and cousin <a href="/wiki/St%C3%A9phanie_de_Beauharnais" title="Stéphanie de Beauharnais">Stéphanie</a> and arranged dynastic marriages for them.

<p>Joséphine had lovers, including a <a href="/wiki/Hussar" title="Hussar">Hussar</a> lieutenant, Hippolyte Charles, during Napoleon's Italian campaign.<sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178"><span>[</span>168<span>]</span></a></sup> Napoleon learnt the full extent of her affair with Charles while in Egypt, and a letter he wrote to his brother Joseph regarding the subject was intercepted by the British. The letter appeared in the London and Paris presses, much to Napoleon's embarrassment. Napoleon had his own affairs too: during the Egyptian campaign he took Pauline Bellisle Foures, the wife of a junior officer, as his mistress. She became known as <i><a href="/wiki/Cleopatra" title="Cleopatra" class="mw-redirect">Cleopatra</a></i> after the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egyptian</a> ruler.<sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179"><span>[</span>169<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181"><span>[</span>note 12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>While Napoleon's mistresses had children by him, Joséphine did not produce an heir, possibly because of either the stresses of her imprisonment during the <a href="/wiki/Reign_of_Terror" title="Reign of Terror">Reign of Terror</a> or an abortion she may have had in her twenties.<sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182"><span>[</span>171<span>]</span></a></sup> Napoleon ultimately chose divorce so he could remarry in search of an heir. In March 1810, he married <a href="/wiki/Marie_Louise,_Duchess_of_Parma" title="Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma">Marie Louise</a>, Archduchess of Austria, and a great niece of <a href="/wiki/Marie_Antoinette" title="Marie Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> by <a href="/wiki/Proxy_marriage" title="Proxy marriage">proxy</a>; thus he had married into a <a href="/wiki/German_monarchs_family_tree" title="German monarchs family tree" class="mw-redirect">German royal and imperial family</a>. They remained married until his death, though she did not join him in exile on Elba and thereafter never saw her husband again.

<p>Napoleon suffered various military setbacks however: Aspern-Essling in 1809, Russia in 1812 and at Leipzig in 1813.

With the exception of two small scale battles in Italy, Napoleon was not defeated in a field battle without being heavily outnumbered.</p>
<p>Under Napoleon, a new emphasis towards the destruction, not just outmanoeuvring, of enemy armies emerged. Invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political impact of war increased significantly; defeat for a European power meant more than the loss of isolated enclaves.
